1) Fix sensor object and it's initialization (when parsing w3w file)
	-We must retrieve the "coordinates" field as the point for the sensor
	**NOT the vertices of the W3W tile

2) Check for distance:
	The length of a move must be exactly 0.0003 degrees

	1) Check if an edge is possible in one move (distance +- 0.0002 = 0.0003)
		1.1) If so then we must check if the range of possible angles at this length are valid
		1.2) If not then we must do a fragmented edge (check paint diagram)

2) Calculate angle:
	Use the tangent of the path line (line from previous sensor to next sensor) as a way to calculate the
	range of angles.

	-Once the appropriate angle is found we can try vary the lat/lng (within the error radius) s.t. the 
	 distance between points is 0.0003.
	-If the distance between the 2 points is greater than 0.0003 we can conjoin 2 paths

CHECKS:
1) If path goes through building
2) If path goes through confinement area

EDGE CASES:
1) drone has to move before taking a reading (if there is a sensor in range from start point).

USEFUL TACTIC FOR GETTING TO NEXT SENSOR:
if distance between the 2 sensors is not sufficient:
	Then take the angle between the 2 sensors and make a move that equates their lat/lng.
	We know the angle between this new point and the destination point is valid.

IMPORTANT:
-drone can finishing close to the start point (within 0.0003 degrees)
-can add sensor markers to Geo-JSON text variable before route finding
